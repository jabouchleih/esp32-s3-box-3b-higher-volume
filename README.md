services:
  esphome:
    container_name: esphome
    image: ghcr.io/esphome/esphome
    volumes:
      - <MYPATH>/esphome/config:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - USERNAME=randomuser
      - PASSWORD=randompassword
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 6052:6052
```

Access the ESP Home Portal through the IP of your Docker host on port 6052 (e.g mydockerhost:6052).

Add a new device, press continue and enter a name for your configuration, for example: "My Voice Assistant".
